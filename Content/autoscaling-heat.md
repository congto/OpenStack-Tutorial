###Autoscaling with Heat
The Heat orchestration service can help with one of the most important topics in cloud computing: scalability. When a cloud application suffers for heavy load, there are two ways to scale:

1. **Vertical Scale.** This is the most obvious solution: when the server resources are not enough, use a more powerful server. You can resize the compute instance, where the application runs, to a larger flavor, so that it gets more CPUs, more RAM or more disk space.
2. **Horizontal Scale**:
