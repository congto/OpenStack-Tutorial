###Autoscaling with Heat
The Heat orchestration service can help with one of the most important topics in cloud computing: scalability. When a cloud application suffers for heavy load, there are two ways to scale:

1. **Vertical Scale.** This is the most obvious solution: when the server resources are not enough, use a more powerful server. Vertical scaling resizes the compute instance to a larger flavor, so that it gets more CPUs, more RAM and more disk space. This type of scaling works well up to a point. Once the maximum supported number of CPUs, RAM and disk space that an instance can have, there are no way to scale more. If the load generated by users continues to grow beyond that, we need to find a different way to scale.

2. **Horizontal Scale.** The other approach to scalability is to have the application running on a cluster of multiple servers. When an application runs on two or more instances, a load balancer is required to distributes client requests among servers. In this way, the application will be able to handle much larger volumes of clients. With this type of scaling, it is going to take longer to reach limits, since we continue to add servers behind the load balancer until we exhaust compute resources in the cloud.
